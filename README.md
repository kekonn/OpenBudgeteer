OpenBudgeteer is a budgeting app based on the Bucket Budgeting Principle and inspired by [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com) and [Buckets](https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com). The Core is based on .NET and the MVVM Pattern, the Front End uses Blazor Server.

    -v 'data:/srv'  \
    'axelander/openbudgeteer:pre-release'
```
